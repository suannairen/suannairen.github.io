Qi Hongsheng, PhD, associate professor at the Institute of Intelligent Transportation, School of Civil Engineering, Zhejiang University, is mainly engaged in the research of dynamic modeling and analysis of traffic behavior and spatial coupling of cities and urban agglomerations under mobile Internet environment, traffic flow theory, evolution of traffic congestion, and management optimization under CAV conditions. He presided over 2 National Natural Science Foundation projects, 973 project sub-projects, 2 sub-projects of key projects of Natural Science Foundation, 2 sub-projects of key research and development projects, and more than 10 other provincial and ministerial projects. He has studied and developed traffic flow models for signal-controlled road networks, traffic congestion diffusion models, and road network supply and demand balance control technologies. The research results have been industrialized and widely used. More than 80 papers have been published and retrieved in domestic and foreign academic journals such as SCI/EI. As the first inventor, he has been authorized with more than 13 Chinese invention patents and 3 US patents. He has published 1 English monograph and 1 co-authored book (he is responsible for 101,000 words), and won the first prize of Jilin Science and Technology Progress Award, the Science and Technology Award of China Intelligent Transportation Association, and the WTC Outstanding Paper Award.
