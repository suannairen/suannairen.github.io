The course of Intelligent algorithm of traffic optimization is an important basic course for the major of transportation engineering master student, as well as an important degree course for the graduate students majoring in traffic engineering. The course begins from the calculus, advanced statistics, and linear algebra. It summarizes the optimization problem in transportation engineering from a broad and deep viewpoint. At the same time, distill the essence of the intelligent algorithm from the viewpoint of stochastic optimization. Also, the algorithm based on swarm optimization is summarized. The main contents include: some important optimization problem in the transportation engineering field, the basics of the optimization, the pseudo random number generation, Monte Carlo and MCMC method, MCTS, BOA algorithm, TS, GA algorithm, SA algorithm, and so on. Extra content include the application of deep net in the optimization.
